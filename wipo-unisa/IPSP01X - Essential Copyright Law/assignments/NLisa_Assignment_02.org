* Henry is a junior programmer at XYZ Software.
** Who is the author and who is the copyright owner in the programs? [6]
According to [article 10(1)]cite:wto17_trips and [article
4]cite:wipo96_copyright_treaty, computer programs are protected as `literary
works' as defined in [article 2]cite:wipo86_berne. Moreover as per the
definition in [section 1]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, Meagan is the author of the
work. As Henry's supervisor she exercised control over the making of the
computer program.\\

Meagan authored the program during the course of her employment by XYZ, it
follows by [section 21(d)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, that XYZ owns the copyright.
** What is the duration of copyright in a computer program? [2]
As per [section 3(2)(b)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, the longer term between fifty
years from the end of the year in which the work is either first published or
made publicly available with the author's consent. Or should neither be
satisfied then fifty years from the end of the year in which the work is made.
** Can the Reverse engineering exception [section 15(3A)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact apply to computer programs? [2]
   No. As per [section 19B(2)(c)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, copyright will be
   infringed unless one is in lawful possession of a computer program or
   authorised copy thereof, moreover one destroys such copies when they cease to
   be lawful.
* Explain the importance of [section 21(1)(e)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact. [5]
  [section 21(1)(b-d)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact stipulate ownership of
  copyright. In particular, should the work have been undertaken during the
  course of employment or contract or commission or apprenticeship, the ownership
  of the copyright will vest with the proprietor of the institution (or commissioner)
  requesting / paying for the work. The importance of the clause, is that the
  owner of the copyright s subject to the Moral Rights clause [section
  20(1)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, and thus cannot adapt the work in such a way as
  to bring the original author's honour or reputation into disrepute. This will
  amount to infringement of copyright, [section 20(2)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact,
  and the author can claim ownership of the copyright in question.
* Does this constitute moral rights infringement? [10]
  As per [section 1]cite:rsa78_copyrightact the photo constitutes an
  _artistic work_. Moreover as per [section 1(1)(c)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, the
  photo appearing in the magazine's October issue constitutes a _adaptation_ of
  Ringo's original work. Ringo is the original author of the photograph,
  responsible for it's original composition; and he is also the first owner of the copyright that subsists in that work [section 21(1)(a).\\

  By submitting his photograph as an entry in the competition, as per [section
  7(a-b)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, Ringo authorized[fn::Pending further
  investigation of the competition's terms and conditions] the magazine to
  publish and / or reproduce the photograph in their August edition.\\

  However, as per [section 7(e-f)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, is was unlawful for
  the magazine to make an adaptation of Ringo's photo and publish said
  adaptation without either consent from the copyright owner nor acknowledgement
  of the original author.\\

  Should Ringo be able to demonstrate that the October edition of the magazine
  and its depiction of the adapted photograph is prejudicial to his honour or
  reputation, provided he did not agree to transfer the copyright of the photo
  when entering the competition, then as per [section 20
  (1-2)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, he can claim authorship of the work, argue that
  the magazine infringed on his moral rights, that they also infringed on
  his copyright, and finally he could argue that they be liable for damages and
  / or royalties.
* Identify three exceptions in [section 12]cite:rsa78_copyrightact that can possibly excuse copyright infringement. [3]
  Newspaper B can argue that they have not infringed on Newspaper A's copyright:
  1. As per [section 12(7)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, provided that the content
     was a current economic, political or religious topic, Newspaper B did not
     infringe copyright, as long as they mentioned the source and Newspaper A
     has not expressly reserved the copyright in that article,
  2. As per [section 12(8)(a), if the content was news of the day that amounts
     to mere items of press information, then no copyright shall subsist in
     Newspaper A's content.
  3. As per [section 12(3)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, quotations from articles in
     newspapers do not infringe copyright provided these quotations constitute
     /fair use/, and that the original source and authors are mentioned.
  4. As per [section 12(1)(b)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact their use of the content
     in question constitutes fair dealing and for the purposes of criticism or
     review of that content or another work, and as per [section
     12(c)(i)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, for the purpose of reporting current
     events in a newspaper; provided that the original source and author where mentioned,
  5. As per [section 12(2)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, had the content been judicial proceedings, that could argue that their reproduction of the content was to report on judicial proceedings.

* Copyright shall not be infringed by any quotation from a work which is lawfully available to the public. [10]
** Name the section and list the requirements that deal with this defence. label:subsec:defence_public_quotations

   Section 12. General exceptions from protection of literary and musical works,
   subsection 3. As per [section 12(3)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, for this particular defence it is required that:
   - the quotation is compatible with /fair practice/ or that it constitutes
     /fair use/,
   - the extent to which the quotation is implemented does not exceed the extent
     justified by the purpose,
   - the source is mentioned in the quotation,
   - the name of the author shall be mentioned should it appears on the work.
** Does answer in ref:subsec:defence_public_quotations, differ from requirements set out in [article 10(1),10(3)] cite:wipo86_berne?
   No, the two legal instruments corroborate one another.
** Why are cite:rsa78_copyrightact and cite:wipo86_berne so similar?
   All members of the World Trade Organization are obliged to comply with the
   substantive provisions in cite:wipo86_berne. Moreover South Africa is a Berne
   Convention member Union country. Naturally it would follow that the Copyright
   Act of South Africa would therefore at the very least comply with, if not
   directly resemble the Berne Convention.
* What are the requirements for the assignment (transfer) of copyright? [2]
  As per [section 22(1)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, one can transfer or assign
  copyright as movable property by assignment, testamentary disposition, or
  operation of law. However as per [section 22(3)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, the
  assignment of copyright shall have effect only if it is in writing and signed by
  or on behalf of the corresponding assignor.
* Name and briefly explain the remedies for copyright infringements. [10]
As per [section 24(1)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, at the suit
of the owner of a copyright and as per [section 25(1)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact,
at the suit of the exclusive (sub-)licensee of the copyright, one may take
action against infringements of that copyright, where the plaintiff may be
awarded relief by way of:
** Damages
   As per [section 24(1),(1A),(1B)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, the plaintiff
   may be entitled to damages or royalties in lieu of damages, where the court
   may direct an enquiry to determine a reasonable amount at its
   discretion. However, should the defendant prove that at the time the
   copyright infringement occurred, he was neither aware nor had any reasonable
   grounds to suspect that copyright subsisted in the work, then the plaintiff
   shall not be entitled to any damages as per [section 24(2)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact.
** Interdict
   As per [section 24(1)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, the court may direct the
   defendant to cease exploitation of the infringing copies.
** Delivery of infringing copies
   As per [section 24(1)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, the court may direct the
   defendant to provide the plaintiff with all infringing copies, all plates
   used or intended to be used for infringing copies or otherwise.
** Fine
   As per [section 27(6)(a-b)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact, should a defendant be
   convicted of infringing the plaintiff's copyright, he'll be liable to a fine
   and / or imprisonment for each article to which the offence relates:
   - a fine not exceeding five thousand rand and / or imprisonment up to three
     years in the case of a first conviction,
   - a fine not exceeding ten thousand rand and / or imprisonment up to five years.
** Restriction on the importation of goods
   As per [section 28(1)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact the owner of the copyright in
   any published work may request the Commissioner for Customs and Excise to
   treat infringing copies as prohibited goods, provided they were made
   outside[fn::It would constitute and infringing copy had it been made within
   the Republic.] the Republic, [section 28(2)]. As per [section
   28(4)]cite:rsa78_copyrightact the infringer will not be liable for any
   penalties under the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964, other than the
   forfeiture of any /prohibited/ goods.
