* Discuss quotation from [citetitle:dijkhorst81_atlas_v_pikkewyn] cite:dijkhorst81_atlas_v_pikkewyn and its compliance with international conventions and other instruments to determine whether competition is unlawful. [10]

  The law of Republic recognises and grants a general action in the case of
  unlawful competition based on the principles of /lex Aquilia./ As per *the
  quotation* from Judge van Dijkhorst cite:dijkhorst81_atlas_v_pikkewyn the
  difficulty in establishing an action in the case of unlawful competition is to
  quantify the degree of unfairness and \ or dishonesty. Moreover, as per Judge
  van Dijkstra, the ideal legal instrument is one in which the framework for
  establishing or trying unlawful competition is well defined and robust enough
  to provide adequate direction to the courts, but not so rigid as to restrict
  the sentiment of an environment of fair play and open competition.\\

  As per [article 10^{bis}]cite:wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip, where it is
  stipulated that (1) Union member countries must provide adequate protection for
  the nationals against unfair competition; (2) dishonest[fn::Any acts of
  competition contrary to honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.]
  acts of competition constitutes acts of unfair competition; and finally (3) a
  detailed list and description of the forms and nature of acts that would
  constitute unlawful competition. *The quotation* indeed complies with the
  requirements of citetitle:wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip.\\

  In corroboration to the above [article 1]cite:wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp
  emphasises that in the course of industrial or commercial activities an act or
  practice that is contrary to honest practices shall be deemed as an act of
  unfair competition. Moreover cite:wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp does not
  require the entities to be in direct competition, unlike
  cite:wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip. The basis for much of the provisions and
  notes of citetitle:wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp, are based on those
  described in [article 10^{bis}]cite:wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip, albeit in much
  more detail and specifics. *The quotation* does indeed comply with these
  requirements.\\

  As per [article 40]cite:wto17_trips, members of the World Trade Organisation,
  members are free to determine appropriate methods in implements it's
  provisions, moreover regarding competition cite:wto17_trips gives particular
  attention to intellectual property rights, their abuse and subsequent adverse
  effects in relevant markets, trade, transfer and dissemination of
  technology. For the most part *the quotation* is in agreement with the
  provisions of cite:wto17_trips.
