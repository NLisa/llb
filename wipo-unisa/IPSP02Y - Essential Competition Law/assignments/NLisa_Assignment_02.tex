\section{Discuss quotation from [\citetitle{dijkhorst81_atlas_v_pikkewyn}] \cite{dijkhorst81_atlas_v_pikkewyn} and its compliance with international conventions and other instruments to determine whether competition is unlawful. [10]}
\label{sec:org53f9441}

The law of Republic recognises and grants a general action in the case of
unlawful competition based on the principles of \emph{lex Aquilia.} As per \textbf{the
quotation} from Judge van Dijkhorst \cite{dijkhorst81_atlas_v_pikkewyn} the
difficulty in establishing an action in the case of unlawful competition is to
quantify the degree of unfairness and $\backslash$ or dishonesty. Moreover, as per Judge
van Dijkstra, the ideal legal instrument is one in which the framework for
establishing or trying unlawful competition is well defined and robust enough
to provide adequate direction to the courts, but not so rigid as to restrict
the sentiment of an environment of fair play and open competition.\\

As per [article 10\(^{\text{bis}}\)]\cite{wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip}, where it is
stipulated that (1) Union member countries must provide adequate protection for
the nationals against unfair competition; (2) dishonest\footnote{Any acts of
competition contrary to honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.}
acts of competition constitutes acts of unfair competition; and finally (3) a
detailed list and description of the forms and nature of acts that would
constitute unlawful competition. \textbf{The quotation} indeed complies with the
requirements of \citetitle{wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip}.\\

In corroboration to the above [article 1]\cite{wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp}
emphasises that in the course of industrial or commercial activities an act or
practice that is contrary to honest practices shall be deemed as an act of
unfair competition. Moreover \cite{wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp} does not
require the entities to be in direct competition, unlike
\cite{wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip}. The basis for much of the provisions and
notes of \citetitle{wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp}, are based on those
described in [article 10\(^{\text{bis}}\)]\cite{wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip}, albeit in much
more detail and specifics. \textbf{The quotation} does indeed comply with these
requirements.\\

As per [article 40]\cite{wto17_trips}, members of the World Trade Organisation,
members are free to determine appropriate methods in implements it's
provisions, moreover regarding competition \cite{wto17_trips} gives particular
attention to intellectual property rights, their abuse and subsequent adverse
effects in relevant markets, trade, transfer and dissemination of
technology. For the most part \textbf{the quotation} is in agreement with the
provisions of \cite{wto17_trips}.
