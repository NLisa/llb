\section{Identify three forms of unlawful competition which are applicable in the given scenario. [6]}
\label{sec:org5cd25b0}
Brian may seek relief, amongst other grounds, on the basis of:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Passing off}, in light of the similarities of the registered trademarks both companies operate under, as per [article
10\(^{\text{bis}}\)(3)(1)]\cite{wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip}, [article
2(1)]\cite{wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp} and [article 16(1)]\cite{wto17_trips}.
\item \emph{Damage another's goodwill or reputation}, specifically the \textbf{Dilution of their
goodwill or reputation}, in regard to the lessening of distinctive character
or advertising value of the CHICKENBITE trademarks, as well as the appearance and
presentation of the product, as per [article 3(2)]\cite{wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp}
\item \textbf{Unfair competition in respect of secret information}, where Danny unlawfully
acquired the memory stick with the recipe discovered by Brian, as per
[article 39(2)]\cite{wto17_trips} and [article 6(1)]\cite{wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp}.
\end{itemize}
