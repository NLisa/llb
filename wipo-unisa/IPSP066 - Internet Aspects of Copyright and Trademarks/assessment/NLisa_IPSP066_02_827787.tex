\section{Will Sibusiso be liable if consent from the rights holders has not been obtained? To whom will he be liable?}
\label{sec:org273c639}

As a Convention Member the provisions of [section 5]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},
[section 104(c,d)]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act}, [Article
9(1)]\cite{wto17_trips}, [Article 1(2)]\cite{eurlex00_elec_commerce}, [Article
5(2)]\cite{wipo86_berne} and [Article 1(4)]\cite{wipo96_copyright_treaty} which
dictate that the statues of the Republic shall govern international copyright
protection as it pertains to the Internet. Furthermore as per the provisions of
[sections 1 and 2(1)(b,e)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [sections 101 and
102(a)(2,7)]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act} and [Article
2(1)]\cite{wipo86_berne} the sound recordings shall be considered as \textbf{protected
artistic works} or \textbf{sound recordings}, where the samples of those works
constitute \textbf{adaptations} or \textbf{derivative works}.\\

As per the provisions of [sections 1, 3, 4(1)(a)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},

[Articles 2 and 3]\cite{wipo96_wppt}, [Article 3 and 9(1)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, the
\textbf{authors}, will in this instance be considered as the rights holders of the
sound recording samples, and they are understood to be the performers,
producers, licensees and broadcasting organisations of the sound recordings.\\

Linking is a means of exploiting third-party content on the Internet, and thus
enhancing a web-page with coloured or underlined descriptive words \textbf{Hyperlinked}
to Uniform Resource Locator (URL), linking to the audio samples. The mere
creation of the links does not in and of themselves constitute copyright
infringement.\\

However, depending on the licensing / contractual conditions of the links to the
samples, Sibusiso may find himself liable to the proprietors and content
generators of the sites hosted on servers in the United States of America on
which the samples appear, \textbf{in addition to} the original authors of the sound
recordings for contributory infringement, should the sound recordings be hosted
on those American servers illegally.

\section{Where will an infringement action against him be instituted?}
