\section{Give a list of fifteen (15) questions that you will ask Sibusiso in order to advise him in this matter.}
\label{sec:org62ab85a}

\subsection{What is the `nature' of the Sound Recordings Sibusiso wishes to sell on his website?}
\label{sec:orgaafbc12}
As per the definitions of [section 2(1)]\cite{rsa93_tm_act} and given that the
Republic is a Paris Convention Member State, [article 15(1)]\cite{wto17_trips},
[article 1(2)]\cite{wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip}, it follows that
\emph{`UNITED.gTLD'} and \emph{`UNITED.ccTLD} will be understood to be \textbf{marks}, in that
they are names or signs capable of being represented graphically. Moreover
\emph{`UNITED.COM'} constitutes a \textbf{well-known registered service} or \textbf{trade mark} in
the United States of America in relation to distinguishing their trade or use
from other goods or services connected in the course of trade regarding
\emph{`airline and courier services.'}, as per the provisions of [Class 39 -
Transport; packaging and storage of goods, travel
arrangements]\cite{wipo57_ncl}.\\

As per the provisions of \cite{wipo57_ncl}, Sibusiso would be advised to pursue
trade mark registration of the `united' mark under:
\begin{itemize}
\item Class 35: advertising; business management/administration - \emph{``in particular the bringing together, for the benefit of others, a variety of goods enabling customers to conveniently view and purchase those goods; such services may be provided by\ldots{} means of electronic media, for example, through web sites\ldots{}''}, and
\item Class 41: education; providing of training; entertainment; sporting and
cultural activities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Has Sibusiso already approached an ICANN-Accredited reseller to query the availability of UNITED.COM?}
\label{sec:orgfe28459}
In order to reserve such a domain name in a general Top-Level Domain or \textbf{gTLD},
the \textbf{registrant} Sibusiso must register it with an ICANN-accredited
registrar\footnote{Or alternatively through a registrar's resellers.}
\cite{icann13_rules}. The registrar will then check if the UNITED.gTLD domain name
is available, and then either create or lookup a WHOIS (domain name registration
record) with the registrant's information \cite{icann99_policy}. The registrant would be advised
against the pursuit of gTLD of the `united' domain name, as he is not likely to
be successful. In particular, while the `united' trade mark may be territorial by
its very nature, the specific `united.com' domain name cannot be owned by
multiple companies, irrespective of the uniqueness of their products and / or
markets.\\

\subsection{Has Sibusiso considered ccTLD registration or an alternative domain name?}
\label{sec:orgd8109ad}
The registrant would be advised to instead pursue registration of the country
code Top-Level Domain or \textbf{ccTLD} domain `united.co.za', through one of the ccTLD
operators [section 59]\cite{rsa02_elect_comm_trans_act}, particularly if the
students he intends to sell sound recordings to are based within the Republic.
This will be assigned on a first-come first-serve basis. Alternatively, he could
pursue registration of a more descriptive domain name, such as
`studentsoundz.co.za', for example.

\subsection{Does Sibusiso understand that he could be liable for trade mark infringement?}
\label{sec:orgc445640}
As per the provisions of [sections 10(6) and 35]\cite{rsa93_tm_act} \emph{(for
litigation within the Republic)}, [Article 16 subsections (1), (2) and
(3)]\cite{wto17_trips}, [Article
6\textsuperscript{\textit{bis}}(1)]\cite{wipo83_paris_conve_protect_ip},
[Article 16]\cite{wipo70_tlt} and [subsection 1125(c)]\cite{usa46_title15_ch22}
\emph{(for actions within the United States of America)}, the proprietors of the
second level domain `united', as is the case with the airline company, may argue
that it is indeed a \textbf{well-known} mark and that registration of Sibusiso's domain
name in either a gTLD or ccTLD, constitutes trade mark infringement, through the
\textbf{dilution} of a well-known mark.

\subsection{Has Sibusiso already began trading under the `united' and has he in any way exploited the good will or brand of the UNITED.Com airline company?}
\label{sec:org9fe0ed5}
Dilution protection is not subject to the same limitations of `traditional'
trade mark infringement,\footnote{Restricted to goods and services which are the same or similar to those for which the mark is registered.\label{orgf35f312}} in that it extends to use of the offending mark to
\emph{any} goods and services. The proprietors of the UNITED.com Airlines trade
mark and domain name, need demonstrate that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Their mark is well known within the Republic, i.e. it would be sufficient for
them to show that their trade mark has acquired a reputation amongst a
substantial number of members of the public,
\citetitle{corbett97_mcd_v_joburgers} \cite{corbett97_mcd_v_joburgers},
\item Sibusiso has used the mark in the course of trade, where the courts of
the Republic view this in the `traditional' trade mark infringement\textsuperscript{\ref{orgf35f312}}
sense, \citetitle{harms01_cowbell_v_ics} \cite{harms01_cowbell_v_ics}, lastly
\item Use of the infringing mark is likely to take unfair advantage of, or be
detrimental to the distinctive character of the UNITED Airlines trade mark,
amounting to unfair competition [articles 2(1) and 3(2)(a)(i)]\cite{wipo96_model_provi_unfair_comp}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Is there any other procedure that could be instituted to resolve the dispute?}
\label{sec:orgc84f34a}
ICANN provides a Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy which outlines
provisions [section 4(a)(i)]\cite{icann99_policy}, within which mandatory
administrative proceedings may be instituted, on the basis that as a \textbf{third
party complainant} UNITED Airlines asserts that Sibusiso's domain is identical
or confusingly similar to their trade or service mark over which they have
rights to.\\

As per the provisions of [Chapter 2, Paragraphs 110 -
111]\cite{wipo99_management_dns_ip_report}, Sibusiso may institute Submission to
Jurisdiction and to Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedures. The ADR procedures to
follow are described and outlined in Chapter 3: Resolving Conflicts in a
Multijurisdictional World with a Global Medium: A Uniform Dispute-Resolution
Policy.

\subsection{Sibusiso wants to place samples from the sound recordings for sale on his web site.}
\label{sec:org89f1777}
As a Convention Member the provisions of [Article 9(1)]\cite{wto17_trips},
[section 5]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [Article 1(2)]\cite{eurlex00_elec_commerce},
[Article 5(2)]\cite{wipo86_berne} and [Article 1(4)]\cite{wipo96_copyright_treaty}
which dictate that the statues of the Republic shall govern international
copyright protection as it pertains to the Internet. Furthermore as per the
provisions of [sections 1 and 2(1)(b,e)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact} and [Article
2(1)]\cite{wipo86_berne} the sound recordings shall be considered as \textbf{protected
artistic works} or \textbf{sound recordings}.

\subsection{Which holders of intellectual property rights may be affected by this?}
\label{sec:org309e5d3}

As per the provisions of [Article 14]\cite{wto17_trips}, [sections 1, 3,
4(1)(a)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [Articles 2 and 3]\cite{wipo96_wppt}, [Article 3
and 9(1)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, the \textbf{authors}, and they are understood to be the
performers, producers, licensees and broadcasting organisations of the sound
recordings.

\subsection{Which of their rights may be affected?}
\label{sec:org9918ef7}
\begin{itemize}
\item Exclusive right of reproduction [section 9(a)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},
[Article 9(1) and (2)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, [Article 7 and 11]\cite{wipo96_wppt}
and [Article 2(a-e)]\cite{eurlex01_harmonisation},

\item Exclusive right of offering by way of trade, directly or indirectly, a
reproduction of the sound recording [section 9(b)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},

\item Exclusive right of publication, distribution or broadcast to the public, or
causing the sound recording to be transmitted in a diffusion service [section
9(c-d)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [Article
11\textsuperscript{bis}(1)(i)-(ii)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, [Article
6(1)]\cite{wipo96_copyright_treaty}, [Article 8(1) and 12(1)]\cite{wipo96_wppt}
and [Article 4]\cite{eurlex01_harmonisation},

\item Exclusive right of communication to the public of a performance [section
9(e)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [Article 11(1)(i)-(ii)]\cite{wipo86_berne},
[Article 8]\cite{wipo96_copyright_treaty}, [Article 13-15]\cite{wipo96_wppt} and
[Article 3]\cite{eurlex01_harmonisation}, and

\item Exclusive right\footnote{Sampling constitutes an adaptation.} of adaptation,
arrangement and other alteration [section 6(f-g)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},
[Article 12]\cite{wipo86_berne} and [Article 16]\cite{wipo96_wppt}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Does he need their permission to do so? What form will such permission take?}
\label{sec:orgc217367}

Yes indeed, by way of a license, [section 22]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact} and
[Article 13(1)]\cite{wipo86_berne}.

\subsection{If he does not obtain their permission, will HostNet also be legally liable?}
\label{sec:org5593bca}

With respect to Sibusiso's intellectual property rights infringement, the
intermediary service provider HostNet shall \uline{\textbf{not}} be legally liable, for
activities conducted during the course of its trade:
\begin{itemize}
\item Information transmission or acting as a \textbf{`mere conduit'} [Article 12]\cite{eurlex00_elec_commerce},
\item Temporary information storage \textbf{`caching'} [Article 13]\cite{eurlex00_elec_commerce}, and
\item Hosting [Article 14]\cite{eurlex00_elec_commerce}.
\end{itemize}

Moreover there exist provisions against statutory requirements obliging HostNet
to monitor Sibusiso's activities on their respective servers [Article 15]\cite{eurlex00_elec_commerce}.


\subsection{Will Sibusiso be liable if consent from the rights holders has not been obtained? To whom will he be liable?}
\label{sec:org7af799c}

As a Convention Member the provisions of [section 5]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},
[section 104(c,d)]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act}, [Article
9(1)]\cite{wto17_trips}, [Article 1(2)]\cite{eurlex00_elec_commerce}, [Article
5(2)]\cite{wipo86_berne} and [Article 1(4)]\cite{wipo96_copyright_treaty} which
dictate that the statues of the Republic shall govern international copyright
protection as it pertains to the Internet. Furthermore as per the provisions of
[sections 1 and 2(1)(b,e)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [sections 101 and
102(a)(2,7)]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act} and [Article
2(1)]\cite{wipo86_berne} the sound recordings shall be considered as \textbf{protected
artistic works} or \textbf{sound recordings}, where the samples of those works
constitute \textbf{adaptations} or \textbf{derivative works}.\\

As per the provisions of [sections 1, 3, 4(1)(a)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},
[section 101]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act}, [Article 14]\cite{wto17_trips},
[Articles 2 and 3]\cite{wipo96_wppt}, [Article 3 and 9(1)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, the
\textbf{authors}, will in this instance be considered as the rights holders of the
sound recording samples, and they are understood to be the performers,
producers, licensees and broadcasting organisations of the sound recordings.\\

Linking is a means of exploiting third-party content on the Internet, and thus
enhancing a web-page with coloured or underlined descriptive words \textbf{Hyperlinked}
to Uniform Resource Locator (URL), linking to the audio samples. The mere
creation of the links does not in and of themselves constitute copyright
infringement.\\

However, depending on the licensing / contractual conditions of the links to the
samples, Sibusiso may find himself liable to the proprietors and content
generators of the sites hosted on servers in the United States of America on
which the samples appear, \textbf{in addition to} the original authors of the sound
recordings for contributory infringement, should the sound recordings be hosted
on those American servers illegally.

\subsection{Where will an infringement action against him be instituted?}
\label{sec:orgcc88ded}
Infringement action can be instituted against within the Republic or within the
United States of America. In particular however, given that the defendant
Sibusiso is domiciled or resident of, and his business is registered within the
Republic, the High Courts of the Republic have jurisdiction.\\

However should Sibusiso, the defendant, be a foreign peregrinus (neither
domiciled nor resident) of all South African High and Magistrate Courts, then
the plaintiff's area of residence, or where the conclusion and/or breach of
contract occurred, i.e. the United States, will hold jurisdiction. Regardless
however, the parties cannot themselves submit to or choose a specific
magistrate's courts in their agreement.

\subsection{What law will apply?}
\label{sec:org3447753}
Issues of contract or trade practice law or both may arise in addition to issues
of copyright law. Deepening on the "click-wrap" or implied license, a number of
subjective implications may arise pertaining to the whether Sibusiso was in fact
eligible or not to hyperlink the multimedia material for commercial purposes on
his own website.\\

The following are potential statutory rights of the respective holders that may
be affected, specifically as it pertains to copyright law:

\begin{itemize}
\item Exclusive right of reproduction [section 9(a)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},
[section 106(1)]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act}, [Article 9(1) and
(2)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, [Article 7 and 11]\cite{wipo96_wppt} and [Article
2(a-e)]\cite{eurlex01_harmonisation},

\item Exclusive right of offering by way of trade, directly or indirectly, a
reproduction of the sound recording [section 9(b)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [section 106(3)]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act},

\item Exclusive right of publication, distribution or broadcast to the public, or
causing the sound recording to be transmitted in a diffusion service [section
9(c-d)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [Article
11\textsuperscript{bis}(1)(i)-(ii)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, [Article
6(1)]\cite{wipo96_copyright_treaty}, [Article 8(1) and 12(1)]\cite{wipo96_wppt}
and [Article 4]\cite{eurlex01_harmonisation},

\item Exclusive right of communication to the public of a performance [section
9(e)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact}, [section
106(6)]\cite{usa76_title17_us_copyright_act}, [Article
11(1)(i)-(ii)]\cite{wipo86_berne}, [Article 8]\cite{wipo96_copyright_treaty},
[Article 13-15]\cite{wipo96_wppt} and [Article 3]\cite{eurlex01_harmonisation},
and

\item Exclusive right\footnote{Sampling constitutes an adaptation.} of adaptation,
arrangement and other alteration [section 6(f-g)]\cite{rsa78_copyrightact},
