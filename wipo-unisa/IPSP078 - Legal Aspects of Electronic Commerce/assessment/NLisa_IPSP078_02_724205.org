** List five legal challenges that electronic commerce poses [5].

Electronic commerce poses a number of regulatory challenges, which include but are
not limited to:

- Taxation Laws
  - How does one associate electronic transactions with the appropriate
    territory to determine any applicable taxes?
  - Do general taxation, VAT, and custom duties regimes apply and how can double
    taxation be prevented with regards to electronic transactions?
- Banking Laws and Electronic Payments (Cyber Credit and Crypto-Currencies)
  - Do banking regulations apply to and is credit provider authorisation a
    prerequisite for issuing cyber credit?
   Do crypto-currencies constitute legal tender?
- Contract Laws and Evidence
  -
- Liability
- Intellectual Property Rights
- Consumer Protection
- Privacy Issues
- Applicable International Private Laws and Jurisdiction

** Explain the extent to which the Electronic Communication and Transactions Act of 2002 has address these challenges [10].

* Compare and contrast the challenges addressed in the ECT Act with the following [10]:

** The UNCITRAL Model on Electronic Commerce of 1996 [5].

** The SADC Model Law on Electronic Transactions and Electronic Commerce of 2012. In your answer briefly explain what impact the SADC Model will have on the South African legislation and those of neighbouring countries [5].
