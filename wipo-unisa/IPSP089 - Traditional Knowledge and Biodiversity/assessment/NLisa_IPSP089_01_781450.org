** Compare and contrast the terms ``traditional knowledge'' and ``indigenous knowledge''. In your answer state whether the /maca/ plant falls within these definitions. (10)
Traditional knowledge systems, creations, innovations, or cultural expressions
refer to /literary, artistic or scientific works, performances, scientific
inventions or discoveries, designs, marks or symbols/, that have evolved in
response to a changing environment and are inherited from one generation to
another within a particular group of people or their territory.\\

Although there exists no universally accepted formal definition for indigenous
peoples, `indigenous knowledge' is synonymous with and in fact a subset to,
`traditional knowledge' in terms of its scope, transmission and diversity.
Whilst their distinction is indeed subtle, `traditional knowledge' held by
indigenous people, denotes `indigenous knowledge'.\\

For example, knowledge disseminated through traditional means amongst the
Khoisan peoples of Southern Africa, constitutes `indigenous' or `traditional
knowledge'. In contrast however, the information passed down through traditional
means, by colonial Dutch settlers in the Cape can be described as `traditional
knowledge', but *not* 'indigenous knowledge'.\\

Given that the maca has long been valued for its ability to enhance fertility in
humans and livestock, it does indeed constitute `traditional knowledge'.
Moreover, given that indigenous peoples have used it the same way for
generations, as a potato-like food source, as well as a supplement for
livestock, appreciated not only for its rich protein and vitamin content, but
for it's sexual performance and fertility enhancement, such use also constitutes
`indigenous knowledge'.

** How has knowledge been protected customarily? (10)

Informal regimes relied on mechanisms based on non-systematic and undocumented
rules, obligations and rights, that are enforced either by elders or religious
leaders. These regimes are `self-legitimised' within and across the community
though the accrual of consensus to abide by and adhere to these laws and
rules.\\



** What are the problems confronting rights holders (in our case the people in Junin Peru)? (10)
But intellectual property is not only about property. It is also
about recognition of identifiable, human creators and respect
for their contributions. From this perspective, intellectual
property has a very important role to play in protecting the
dignity of the holders of traditional knowledge. By conferring
property rights in relation to such knowledge, those holders
enabled, to a certain extent, to control its use by others.


** What is WIPO's role in protecting traditional knowledge? (20)
