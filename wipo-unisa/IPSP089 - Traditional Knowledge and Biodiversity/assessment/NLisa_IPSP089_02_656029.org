* Question 1 [50]
Discuss the following in respect of traditional cultural expressions
(expressions of folklore):

** Why is there a need to protect expressions of folklore? (20)

Folklore is an important element of a nation's cultural heritage, providing its
people with an avenue for self-expression and it exists as a means of a
country's social identity. Traditional expressions have generally been
characterized as a broad set of oral and or written literary, artistic,
religious, scientific, technological works and other traditions and productions
that are transmitted from one generation to another, and whose creators need not
necessarily be indigenous peoples.\\

With regards to folklore, aspects related to its subject matter, technological
and methodological content need to be taken into consideration. Thus it is
important to consider not only protection from a copyright perspective, but also
the mechanisms of industrial property protection, including patents, trademarks
and industrial designs.\\

The need for protection of expressions of folklore arises where the creators or
rights holders, would need to prevent others from reproducing their creations or
disseminating them to the public through performance or broadcast, /(i.e. law of
copyright)/; and to restrict the unauthorized misappropriation of technological
and methodological ideas, inventions, crafts, designs and carvings, /(i.e. laws
of patents, trademarks and industrial designs)/. Moreover, informal traditional
customary regimes may not provide adequate protection against cultural, economic
or commercial exploitation.\\

Both globalization and the advent of technological telecommunications advances
in recent history, have lead to the improper exploitation of cultural
expressions of folklore currently experienced today. The misappropriation of the
intellectual property rights that /`should'/ be enjoyed by a people, resulting
from their endeavors and accumulated cultural heritage can take a number of
forms, from commercial exploitation to adaptation and distortion of the original
works.\\

There exists a clear need for the development of both national and international
instruments \ frameworks, providing legal protection against the exploitation of
cultural expressions of folklore, without any compensation to their originating
communities. Moreover, litigation processes are also required to reclassify
those expressions of folklore that were previously considered to belong to the
public domain. Not forgetting the subsequent infringement and sanctioning
procedures with regards to infringement of the rights in `works of folklore'.

** The WIPO / UNESCO's Model Provisions on the issue. (30)

As per the provisions of [article 15(4)(a-b)]cite:wipo86_berne, although not
explicitly limited to, nor directly referring to folklore, member Union
countries may use their respective national legislation to designate a competent
authority to represent, protect and enforce the rights of an unknown, but
assumed to be a domiciled in said country, author of an unpublished work.
